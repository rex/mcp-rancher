# TASK_STATE

## Current Objective

Keep the repo clean and fully validated while executing the canonical Rancher MCP implementation plan in phase order against the live Rancher `2.6.5` devlab.

## Standing User Directives

- Most recent standing directive: none active. Awaiting user instruction before starting Phase 5 work.

## Phase Discipline

- Work the oldest incomplete canonical phase first.
- Completed work from later phases stays committed; do not delete it merely because an earlier phase is still open.
- If the working tree already contains in-flight later-phase work, land that slice cleanly before starting anything new.
- Do not start net-new Phase 5+ scope until Phases 3 and 4 are actually closed.
- Update this file and `CHANGELOG.md` at every logical step so future agents can resume without reconstructing state from git history.

## Repo Snapshot

- Canonical plan: `PERFECT_RANCHER_MCP_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- Primary compatibility target: Rancher `2.6.5`
- Public tool surface: 100 tools
- Completion gate: `make check-if-the-agent-can-consider-this-task-completed`
- Active quality gates:
  `make check-architecture`
  `make lint`
  `make typecheck`
  `make test`

## Latest Logical Step

- Phase 3 generic fallback coverage is now complete:
  Norman and Steve list/get/create/apply/patch/delete
  generic action invocation
  generic link following
  Steve watch support
  schema query and capability discovery
- Live Rancher `2.6.5` validation succeeded for:
  Norman project create/apply/patch/delete
  Steve ConfigMap create/apply/patch/delete
- Steve generic mutations are validated through Rancher's Kubernetes proxy paths under `/k8s/clusters/.../api` and `/k8s/clusters/.../apis`, not by assuming direct Steve write paths are reliable on `2.6.5`.

## Architecture Gate Semantics

- Soft `max_lines_per_file.soft` findings are warnings to track.
- Hard `max_lines_per_file.hard` findings fail the architecture gate.
- `max_public_functions_per_module` findings fail the architecture gate.
- A warnings-only architecture run is valid for commit and completion if the rest of the required gates pass.

## Phase Tracker

| Phase | Status | Repo Reality | Remaining To Close |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0. Product and capability definition | completed | `VIBE.yaml`, canonical plan, and capability catalog are committed. | none |
| 1. Project scaffold | completed | `uv`, docs, Makefile, config, hooks, and baseline repo structure are in place. | none |
| 2. Core client and discovery layer | completed | management client, Steve client, discovery/schema tools, streaming substrate, and live `2.6.5` devlab are landed. | none |
| 3. Generic tool engine | completed | generic Norman/Steve list/get/create/apply/patch/delete, action/link, watch support, schema query controls, and contract fixtures are landed and live-validated against the local Rancher `2.6.5` devlab. | none |
| 4. Curated read-only packs | in_progress | settings/features, clusters/nodes, projects/namespaces, pods/services, storage, disruption, workloads, apps/catalogs, auth/identity, RBAC, Fleet/registration, logging/backup, ops aggregate helpers, monitoring status, CIS compliance, Kubernetes events, notifiers, and cluster alert rules are landed. | live validation for newer helpers, compatibility matrix |
| 5. Curated safe write packs | pending | not started intentionally. | blocked on Phase 4 closing |
| 6. Curated high-risk and destructive packs | pending | not started intentionally. | blocked on Phases 4 and 5 closing |
| 7. Subsystem completeness | pending | only the Phase 4 read slices that touch Fleet/logging/backup are landed so far. | Longhorn, deeper monitoring/logging/compliance, backup operator, extensions |
| 8. Live validation and contract capture | partially_completed | local Rancher `2.6.5` lab is working, sanitized contract fixtures are committed, and the Phase 3 generic Norman/Steve mutation flows are now live-validated. | broaden live validation across the remaining Phase 4 packs and capture a compatibility matrix |
| 9. Hardening | partially_completed | retries, stderr logging, strict typing, test coverage gates, and architecture checks are landed. | audit logging, write confirmations, rate limiting, and remaining production hardening |
| 10. Catalog completion and gap closure | pending | no explicit coverage report exists yet. | compare curated coverage to live-discovered capability surface and publish the gap report |

## Landed Curated Packs

- Phase 4 server/platform: settings, features
- Phase 4 inventory: clusters, nodes, projects, namespaces
- Phase 4 workload substrate: pods, services, deployments, daemonsets, statefulsets
- Phase 4 storage/disruption: storage classes, PVs, PVCs, pod disruption budgets
- Phase 4 platform integrations: apps/catalogs, auth/identity, RBAC, Fleet/registration, logging/backup
- Phase 4 operational summaries: cluster health, node summaries, failure finders, namespace/project rollups
- Phase 4 observability: monitoring status, CIS compliance (profiles + scans), Kubernetes events
- Phase 4 alerting: notifiers, cluster alert rules

## Current Risks And Constraints

- The oldest incomplete canonical phase is now Phase 4, so the next net-new feature work should finish the remaining read-only packs before starting safe writes or destructive flows.
- Some landed Phase 4 domains are live-validated only against empty lab collections; keep that distinction explicit in docs and changelog entries.
- Steve generic mutations on Rancher `2.6.5` are validated through Rancher's Kubernetes proxy paths; do not switch them back to direct Steve write paths without fresh live proof.
- The downstream devlab remains `kind`, not true RKE2, so live validation claims must stay precise about what was actually exercised.
- Steve list pagination and some Steve collection paths in Rancher `2.6.5` remain quirky; prefer the already-established Norman/raw-proxy paths that are known-good in this repo.

## Next Queue

1. Produce live validation and compatibility matrix for the newer Phase 4 packs.
2. Start Phase 5 safe-write packs only after receiving explicit user instruction.
